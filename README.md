# Introduction:
"Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today. My name is [Your Name], and I'm here to present the findings from our recent data analytics project for Social Buzz. This project was a collaboration between Andrew Fleming, Marcus Rompton, and myself, Jiya Dariyani. Today, I'll be walking you through our analysis, key insights, and the recommended next steps."

### Slide 1: Project Overview**
"Social Buzz has been experiencing rapid growth, with over 100,000 pieces of content being posted daily. Our project focused on auditing Big Data, providing recommendations for a potential IPO, and analyzing popular content. We aimed to streamline Social Buzz's content management and enhance user engagement."

### Slide 2: Methodology**
"Our approach was methodical and structured. We followed a detailed process which included several key steps:

1. We began by thoroughly reviewing the dataset to understand the types of content being posted and the categories they fall into.
2. Next, we cleaned the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors, ensuring accurate analysis.
3. We then modeled the data to identify patterns and trends. This involved segmenting the content into 16 unique categories.
4. 6 Finally, we concentrated our analysis on the top 5 content categories that showed the highest engagement, providing a clear picture of user preferences."

### Slide 3: Analysis**
"From our analysis, we identified 16 unique content categories. Notably, content related to animals stood out with an aggregated score of 74,965, indicating a high level of engagement. Additionally, we observed that 716 pieces of content received heart reactions, highlighting user preferences and the types of content that resonate most with them."

### Slide 4: Key Insights**
"The key insights from our analysis are as follows:

1. Animal-related content is extremely popular, garnering significant user engagement.
2. The share percentage of the top 5 categories provided a clear distribution of user interaction trends within the platform.
3. Understanding these trends allows us to tailor content strategies to maintain and increase user engagement."

### Slide 5: Recommendations and Next Steps**
"Based on our findings, we recommend focusing on the content categories that generate the most engagement, particularly animal-related content. Enhancing these categories will likely boost user interaction. Additionally, refining our data analysis process to include more granular metrics will provide deeper insights into user behavior. As Social Buzz prepares for a potential IPO, detailed recommendations based on our data audit will be crucial. We suggest continued collaboration to ensure Social Buzz can effectively manage its growth and maintain robust user engagement."

### Conclusion:**
"Thank you for your attention. We believe that these insights and recommendations will help Social Buzz navigate its rapid growth and prepare for a successful IPO. We're excited about the potential for continued collaboration and are here to support you every step of the way. Now, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have."

## “Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Accenture’s Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture, and to use Excel and data analytics and visualization skills in a realistic context.

Through this program I realized that I really enjoy cleaning, modelling and analyzing client data, creating slides to communicate findings and presenting insights back to the client. I would love to apply what I've learned in a diverse project team at a company like Accenture.
